title: About WAHA
---
## Although WAHA was officially founded in 1971, its true beginnings likely grew from the informal community hockey gatherings that sprang up around Westborough in the late 1960s and early 1970s, during a time when youth hockey was flourishing across Massachusetts.

## The decision to incorporate in 1971 marked a pivotal moment: transforming a loose network of volunteers and young athletes into a dedicated nonprofit committed to organized play, skill development, and community-building.

## Today, WAHA carries that legacy forward by providing Westborough’s youth and high-school players with essential support—from ice time and equipment to coaching resources and scholarships.
